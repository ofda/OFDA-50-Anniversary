<p dir="ltr"><span style="color:#16B0C1;font-size: 21px;font-weight: 700;">OFDA's Leading Role in International Urban Search&ndash;and&ndash;Rescue</span><br />
<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Alisha McMichael</span>

<p>Imagine experiencing a disaster&mdash;such as the earthquake in Haiti, the tsunami in Japan, or even Hurricane Sandy in the U.S.&mdash;and being trapped and injured under piles of rubble or debris without knowing if anyone is able to rescue you. It is frightening to think about, but when a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck near Mexico City in 1985, search&ndash;and&ndash;rescue resources were virtually non&ndash;existent&mdash;and the results were catastrophic.</p>

<p>The devastating earthquake caused more than 400 buildings to collapse in Mexico City and damaged thousands more, contributing to more than 10,000 deaths and 30,000 injured persons. Neither trained nor equipped to perform the life&ndash;saving urban search&ndash;and&ndash;rescue (USAR) techniques used today, first responders were helpless to assist many of the victims trapped under the rubble, and lives were lost. This earthquake illustrated the extraordinary level of destruction a natural disaster can cause in an urban area, and it underscored the critical need for improved USAR resources in disaster response efforts.</p>  

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;font weight: 700;">USAR&#146;s Roots with OFDA:  Meeting a Critical Need</span><br />
After witnessing the Mexico City earthquake response, OFDA realized it could fill a gap in overseas USAR capabilities within its mandate to save lives. OFDA convened with national and international disaster response experts to discuss the critical need for search&ndash;and&ndash;rescue resources in future emergency responses. OFDA included rescue as part of its humanitarian efforts and began working with Virginia&#146;s Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department and Florida&#146;s Metro&ndash;Dade (now Miami&ndash;Dade) Fire Rescue Department to vigorously train a robust and professional team of U.S.&ndash;based USAR responders able to deploy overseas on short notice without support from the host country experiencing the disaster.</p>  

<p>The planning was put into action in December 1988 after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Spitak Region of Armenia, located in the USSR at the time of the disaster. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to accept USG assistance for rescue operations&mdash;a historic event during the Cold War&mdash;and OFDA quickly assembled and deployed a combined team of rescuers from Miami&ndash;Dade and Fairfax County to assist in search&ndash;and&ndash;rescue efforts. This first response provided valuable knowledge and hands&ndash;on experience that OFDA used as a foundation for helping to build the international USAR system in place today.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;font weight: 700;">OFDA&#146;s Evolving Role:  Building a Better System</span><br />
As the concept continued to grow in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, OFDA began to assume the role of international USAR leader. In addition to increasing the USAR capacity of U.S. response teams, OFDA began to focus on formalizing the USAR response process. OFDA workshops, attended by international search&ndash;and&ndash;rescue leaders, prompted the creation of the U.N.&#146;s International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) in 1991, a consortium currently comprising more than 80 disaster&ndash;prone and disaster&ndash;responding countries. OFDA supported INSARAG in establishing minimum international standards for USAR teams and a methodology for international coordination&mdash;published in the INSARAG Guidelines in 1999&mdash;as well as a USAR directory and classification system. OFDA also supported INSARAG in the development of the U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) system, which is responsible for assessment, coordination, and information management at disaster sites.</p>  

<p>In addition to supporting the U.N.&#146;s efforts to improve coordination among international USAR teams, OFDA has encouraged the development of national USAR capacity within the disaster response operations frameworks of hazard&ndash;prone countries. Recognizing that first responders to a disaster have the potential to save the most lives, OFDA began introducing USAR concepts into its disaster risk reduction trainings, particularly those countries in Asia and Latin America most frequently affected by natural disasters. OFDA developed the Regional Disaster Assistance Program (RDAP) in Latin America in 1989 and expanded it in 1991 to include the Caribbean countries. In Asia, OFDA initiated the Program for the Enhancement of Emergency Response (PEER) in 1998 to improve disaster response capacity in India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines, and progressively expanded the program to include six additional countries. OFDA has also provided short&ndash;term emergency assistance and USAR training to a number of other countries, such as Iceland, Jordan, and South Africa, as well as shared training information and oversaw the transfer of USAR equipment to China, Japan, and New Zealand following disaster responses.</p>

<p>In the process of improving the international USAR system, OFDA indirectly strengthened emergency response efforts in the United States. In 1989, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) established the National Urban Search&ndash;and&ndash;Rescue Response System as a framework for domestic response efforts. FEMA organized local emergency services personnel into integrated disaster response teams, referred to as task forces, similar to those developed by OFDA for international deployment. The OFDA&ndash;supported Miami&ndash;Dade and Fairfax County USAR teams that had deployed to Armenia joined 26 other teams to form FEMA&#146;s National US&R Response System.</p> 

<p>Today, OFDA maintains agreements with L.A. County and Fairfax County USAR teams, which allow OFDA to activate these teams for international disaster responses when needed.  OFDA also frequently draws on the knowledge and skills of these teams to develop and deliver effective international training programs.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;font weight: 700;">OFDA&#146;s Role Today:  Strengthening USAR Worldwide</span><br />
Training and equipping local emergency personnel to rapidly respond to disasters is one of the most effective ways to save lives. Knowing this, OFDA&#146;s disaster preparedness efforts are now focused primarily on building the capacity of national and regional first responders, including USAR units, which are able to respond to local disasters more quickly than international teams. In Asia, USAR is a major component of the OFDA&ndash;supported PEER program, which has trained more than 2,600 disaster response professionals, including more than 1,800 individuals who attended multiple trainings to build a broader skill set or have graduated to become PEER instructors themselves. To continue building the capacity of national and regional first responders and disaster management agencies, OFDA provided PEER with more than $1 million in funding in FY 2012.</p>

<p>Similarly, the OFDA&ndash;supported RDAP, operating in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), is a comprehensive capacity&ndash;building program with a large USAR component. Governments and organizations from 30 LAC countries currently participate in RDAP, which has trained more than 75,000 people and certified almost 7,000 instructors since it began in 1989. Although RDAP originally focused on training local responders, OFDA shifted from a strictly instructional approach to providing more technical assistance as local experts began conducting disaster management training in the region. OFDA&#146;s support to RDAP now includes working with governments and disaster management organizations on a wide spectrum of activities, such as establishing training programs, assisting with USAR team self&ndash;evaluations and accreditation processes, and strengthening the legal, logistical, and operational foundations for national USAR systems.</p>  

<p>In FY 2012, OFDA&mdash;through RDAP&mdash;employed a country&ndash;specific approach to USAR in LAC, developing trainings and technical assistance programs based on each country&#146;s capabilities, strengths, and challenges. One especially noteworthy accomplishment was the completion of a three&ndash;day, OFDA&ndash;supported mobilization exercise in Mexico. As the largest simulation training held in LAC in 2012, the exercise assessed the performance of Mexican USAR teams and evaluated the coordination between municipal, state, and federal disaster response systems. RDAP is using the training as a model for other LAC countries and expects the lessons learned to assist with building USAR capacity throughout the region. In total, OFDA provided more than $6 million for RDAP activities in the LAC region in FY 2012 to continue strengthening national and regional capacity.</p>  

<p>OFDA remains committed to strengthening the global USAR system. For example, OFDA is engaged with INSARAG and has representatives participating in working groups to refine the INSARAG Guidelines. OFDA also retains a roster of UNDAC members that can deploy rapidly to a disaster site to coordinate USAR response activities. In addition, OFDA has also developed and continues to maintain the Americas Support Team, which provides UNDAC with on&ndash;site logistical and operational support during a disaster in LAC countries.</p>

<p>Due in large part to OFDA&#146;s initiative and leadership, USAR is now a standard component of the international disaster response system, and teams around the world are trained, equipped, and ready to respond when a disaster strikes. Nearly 30 years ago, OFDA created the first U.S.&ndash;based USAR team and began offering search-and-rescue as part of its humanitarian assistance to meet a critical need. Since then, OFDA has continued to lead and support international USAR efforts to build the robust international system in place today. OFDA&#146;s support for strengthening national and regional teams to help themselves and their neighbors has decreased the need for USG USAR assistance. And, most importantly, OFDA&#146;s emphasis on building national and regional capacity has increased the number of lives saved following catastrophic events.</p>
