<p>A family woken by gunshots and screaming.</p>

<p>People killed in horrific acts of violence in front of their loved ones.</p>

<p>Spending months in hiding in the bush and eating leaves.</p>

<p>These have become all too familiar story lines of hundreds of thousands of people in the Central African Republic affected by a conflict that has been going on for nearly two years. Thousands have been killed, nearly a quarter of the population has been displaced from their homes and starvation is threatening those who lost en entire growing season.</p>

<p>&#147;When my village was attacked, my children and I were sleeping. We heard shooting outside. I went out to see what was happening. When I understood that the Selekas were coming to kill us and steal our goods, I grabbed my children and fled into the bush.&#148;</p>

<p>You can feel her panic as Yvonne Sambeté, a 48&ndash;year&ndash;old mother from the northwest of CAR recalls that night when her village was attacked by rebels.</p>

<p>She still remembers exactly what time it was when the rebels entered her village. They came at 4 am on August 22, 2013, guns blazing, killing and burning homes. Yvonne grabbed her two children and fled into the bush, a thick tropical forest sourrounding her village on all sides, where they would spend the next five months, surviving on leaves and wild fruits.</p>

<p>That same fateful day, rebels also killed Barnabé Oueïfio&#146;s wife, a mother of seven and grandmother of seven.</p>

<p>&#147;She was sick, she could not run with us,&#148; the 68&ndash;year&ndash;old man recalls with horror. &#147;When Korakouri, my village, was attacked, we all started to run into the bush but my wife was too sick. While we were running, we heard her scream and then, we heard them shooting at her. It was too late. I had no other choice than running. I had to take the rest of the family somewhere safe.&#148;

<p>&#147;The &#91;rebels&#93; killed my wife publicly. I could not look at the scene. I heard the shooting and understood that it was finished.&#148;</p>

<p>As the conflict in CAR unfolds, its people face not only continued insecurity but also trauma from the events they witnessed and the loved ones they lost. But most of all, they face a daily struggle to survive.</p>

<p>In the violence, which has taken on religious dimensions as mostly Muslim rebels, called Seleka, fight non&ndash;Muslim milita, Anti&ndash;Balaka, thousands of innocent men, women and children have been affected. In a country where 80 percent of the population lives by subsistence farming, missing an entire growing season means a looming food crisis that could affect millions of people.</p>

<p>&#147;Earlier this year, we distributed seeds and tools to families so they could farm their land again and ensure a harvest,&#148; says Melanie Massue, a program manager with Catholic Relief Services. &#147;But in addition to losing their food and seed stocks, people also lost everything from beds and dishes to shoes and soap. Life for Central Africans caught up in this conflict has become a daily struggle to survive and lead a life in dignity.&#148;</p>

<p>But there is hope.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;strong;">Village by Village, Hope Returns to Central African Republic</span><br />

About 30 miles from Bossangoa, a hard&ndash;hit town in the northwest of CAR, frequent attacks and insecurity have left people like Yvonne and Barnabé completely isolated. For many humanitarian organisations, including CRS, it was too unsafe to travel to those areas to provide assistance.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>With relative calm in the area, CRS and its partner Caritas have been able to get aid to people in remote and isolated villages.</p>

<p>On July 10, a CRS convoy trucked essential living supplies to nine villages along that corridor. Funded by USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and with the support of Caritas, more than 2,000 people received items such as kitchen utensils, blankets, plastic mats, buckets, soap and mosquito nets. CRS aims to reach another 4,000 people in coming weeks and is distributing similar items in other hard&ndash;hit areas.</p>

<p>After losing homes and all belongings as their villages were burned and looted, this was the first time in nearly a year that Yvonne and her neighbors received any support.</p>

<p>&#147;I prayed everyday to get some help and help finally came,&#148; she says.</p>

<p>Barnab&#233;, who until this day felt angry, desperate and abandoned, had lost all hope.</p>

<p>&#147;To see him smile for the first time since the attack … it was a great day for our team that day,&#148; Massue says.</p>

<p>Now, Barnab&#233; thinks about the future and has regained his belief that his country will recover.</p>
