<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Alyssa Smith</span>

<p>Mt. Merapi&mdash;Indonesia&#146;s &#147;Mountain of Fire&#148;&mdash;looms over the heavily populated city of Yogyakarta. One of the world&#146;s most active volcanoes, Mt. Merapi began erupting on October 26, 2010, producing the volcano&#146;s largest eruptions in more than 100 years. As the explosive events continued, searing hot gas clouds engulfed communities that sat in Mt. Merapi&#146;s shadow and blanketed them with volcanic ash. The eruptions spewed gas and ash into the air while pyroclastic flows&mdash;extremely hot, fast-moving currents of gas and debris&mdash;sped down Mt. Merapi&#146;s slopes. The flows travelled up to 11 miles from the volcano&#146;s summit, incinerating houses and fields in their path. While the eruptions left serious damage in their wake, early warnings from the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and OFDA-supported USGS volcanologists averted widespread tragedy by saving thousands of lives.</p>

<p>With more than 3 million people living within 6 miles of active volcanoes, Indonesia has the world&#146;s largest population at risk from volcanic hazards. In order to reduce the risks for these vulnerable people, the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP)&mdash;a volcano hazard reduction initiative funded by OFDA and implemented by USGS&mdash;has worked closely with the GoI Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) for several years, providing monitoring equipment and training to Indonesian geologists to prepare for and respond to volcanic events.</p>

<p>While Mt. Merapi has erupted regularly for hundreds of years, the monitoring equipment and training provided by VDAP helped scientists at CVGHM recognize early warning signs of impending large-scale, explosive eruptions in October 2010. Alerted by volcano-related seismic activity, growth of a lava dome at the volcano&#146;s summit, and other indicators that gas-rich magma was ascending quickly to the volcano&#146;s surface, CVGHM notified Indonesian disaster management officials of a potential crisis and requested VDAP assistance.</p>

<p>In response, VDAP immediately started monitoring events at Mt. Merapi remotely from the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington State. VDAP continuously analyzed seismic and satellite data and updated CVGHM on their findings around the clock. In addition, at the request of the GoI, a three-person VDAP team deployed to Yogyakarta to provide on-site support to CVGHM in assessing hazards and forecasting eruptions. CVGHM&#146;s eruption predictions enabled the GoI to provide warnings to populations living near the volcano, leading to the timely evacuation of thousands of people. Utilizing data from radar sensors that could penetrate rain and ash clouds, VDAP relayed information to CVGHM that informed decisions on the appropriate extent of evacuation zones. Although Mt. Merapi&#146;s eruptions resulted in at least 300 deaths, destroyed approximately 2,000 homes, and displaced more than 300,000 people, early warnings and evacuation measures are credited with saving approximately 15,000 lives.</p>  

<p>VDAP&#146;s response to the 2010 Mt. Merapi eruptions is a landmark success in mitigating the impact of volcanic eruptions. The success of the response becomes apparent when compared to the less powerful 1985 eruption of Colombia&#146;s Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, which caused 23,000 deaths due to a lack of warning for nearby communities. The tragic event prompted OFDA and USGS to establish VDAP, forming the world&#146;s only international rapid response volcano crisis team. Many active volcanoes are not continuously monitored, creating the need for a mobile crisis-response unit that can move quickly when a volcano becomes restless, particularly in countries where the scope of the potential disaster overwhelms local capacity. To meet this need, VDAP scientists deploy at the request of host governments and use mobile volcano-monitoring equipment to help their counterparts quickly assess hazards and generate eruption forecasts. VDAP also donates monitoring equipment to local volcano observatory staff, helps its counterparts develop early warning plans, and conducts technology and hazard assessment trainings for national volcano-monitoring organizations.</p>

<p>Since VDAP&#146;s inception, OFDA has provided more than $20 million in support of the program, including more than $1.6 million in FY 2011. To date, VDAP has responded to 26 major crises throughout the world and has worked to build volcano-monitoring capacity in 12 countries, including Indonesia. VDAP assistance has helped save tens of thousands of lives, as well as several hundred million dollars in property damages. At Mt. Merapi, Mt. Pinatubo, and elsewhere, VDAP&#146;s success in helping local governments reduce loss of life and the economic impact of disasters&mdash;two key elements of OFDA&#146;s mandate&mdash;underscores the value of preparing for and mitigating the impacts of volcanic eruptions.</p>
