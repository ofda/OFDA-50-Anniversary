<p>On November 13, 1985, a calamitous eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia stunned the world by nearly erasing an entire town and claiming an estimated 23,000 lives. Shortly after 3:00 p.m. local time, witnesses north of the volcano reported hearing a deep rumble from the mountain and seeing a black plume rise from the summit. Six hours later, two forceful explosions sent a series of pyroclastic flows (hot ash and volcanic fragments) spewing from the crater&mdash;melting part of the summit ice cap and sending torrents of meltwater, ice, and debris cascading down the sides of the volcano. Volcanic mudflows, known as lahars, formed in rivers on the eastern and western slopes of the volcano, and coursed down river channels, sweeping up everything in their paths.</p>

<p>On the western side of the volcano, the town of Chinchina lost 1,800 people. More than 200 houses were washed away, and bridges linking Chinchina to Pereira and Medellin were destroyed. To the east, mudflows stripped away houses and destroyed the bridge on the main road to Bogota. But it was the town of Armero (population 29,170) which sustained the most devastating and shocking losses. Shortly before midnight, successive waves of mudflows over&ndash;ran Armero, dragging homes, cars, and debris toward the Magdalena River. As much as 50 feet of mud blanketed the town, entombing 20,000 bodies, injuring approximately 5,000 people, and obliterating nearly 85 percent of the town. Survivors were trapped by the mud which covered a staggering 14 square miles.</p>

<p>The eruptions also had regional impact. All area roads, bridges, aqueducts, telephone lines, and electrical grids were damaged or destroyed. In addition, public and personal records disappeared in the mire, adding to the confusion and complicating recovery.  A wide expanse of agricultural land, including sixty percent of the region&#146;s livestock, 30 percent of its grain, sorghum, and rice crops, and half a million bags of green coffee were lost in the disaster. Some 50 schools suffered damage or were destroyed and two hospitals were wrecked.</p> 

<p>On November 14, a Volcano Task Force (VTF) was assembled at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota to coordinate the U.S. government&#146;s response efforts. Immediately following the eruption, OFDA supplied tents, tent repair kits, and wool blankets for those who lost their homes. Working with the Department of Defense, helicopters were deployed to assist with evacuation and rescue operations&mdash;transporting approximately 1,100 people and over 315 metric tons of emergency supplies.</p> 

<p>In addition, OFDA coordinated with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to send to the area 20 volcanologists, seismologists, and mudflow experts armed with sophisticated volcano monitoring and warning instrumentation. Once installed, the equipment generated data for scientists at the Manizales Observatory to analyze. The U.S. government later donated the equipment to Colombia and trained Colombian professionals in data collection and equipment maintenance&mdash;contributing to the development of a pool of skilled Colombian volcano experts and the establishment of a permanent volcano monitoring center.</p>

<p>The eruption of Nevado del Ruiz and the devastation that followed shed light on the fact that many active volcanoes are not continuously monitored, prompting OFDA and the USGS to establish the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP). The world&#146;s only international rapid response volcano crisis team, VDAP serves as a mobile crisis&#146;response unit that can move quickly when a volcano becomes restless, particularly in countries where the scope of potential disasters overwhelms local capacity. VDAP scientists use mobile volcano&#146;monitoring equipment to help their counterparts quickly assess hazards and generate eruption forecasts. VDAP also donates equipment to local volcano observatory staff, helps develop early warning plans, and conducts trainings on volcano monitoring.</p>

<p>Since VDAP&#146;s inception, OFDA has provided nearly $24 million in support of the program, including more than $1.9 million in FY 2013. To date, VDAP has responded to 27 major crises throughout the world and has worked to build volcano&ndash;monitoring capacity in 12 countries. VDAP assistance has helped save tens of thousands of lives, as well as several hundred million dollars in property damages. More recent eruptions&mdash;such as the 2010 Mt. Merapi eruption in Indonesia where 15,000 lives were saved&mdash;demonstrate VDAP&#146;s success in helping local governments reduce the loss of life and the economic impact of volcanic eruptions.</p>
