<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Brian Healey, GOAL Logistics Officer</span>

<p><em>In October 2005, a massive earthquake hit northern Pakistan killing over 73,000 people and injuring 69,000. Some 400,000 homes were either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, leaving an estimated 3.3 million people homeless in Azad Jammu, Kashmir and North&ndash;West Frontier Provinces. With support from USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), GOAL travelled to the remote, mountainous Bagh region of Kashmir to provide relief and help rebuild communities. The Bagh District was severely affected by the earthquake and the more than 1,800 aftershocks, with an estimated 90 percent of houses destroyed. After the emergency medical treatment phase had been completed, and as winter approached, the emphasis of the overall aid effort switched to the provision of emergency shelter. GOAL supplied shelter materials and tents to 14,000 people in the highest and most vulnerable villages, and distributed food to 50,000 people. Below is a blog from one of the GOAL aid workers who was there.</em></p>

<p>Winter has been playing games with us here in Kashmir, often presenting its most pleasant face: crisp, sunny days and clear sharp nights. But it is a fickle season, not to be trusted.</p>

<p>The first challenge you face every morning is leaving the warmth of a sleeping bag that you&#146;ve molded yourself into during the night. Abandoning the cozy confinement of your dreams, to face the elements that you fought hard to insulate yourself against. The experience is not dissimilar, I imagine, to diving headfirst into an ice&ndash;cold sea. You hold your breath in anticipation just before forcing yourself to take the plunge.</p>

<p>When you emerge from the tent, it is cold&mdash;really, really cold. You move quickly to grab a warm mug of tea, and huddle over it.</p>

<p>There is some reward each morning, as one is immediately presented with the awesome sight of a neighboring mountain beginning to stick its head above the scarf of cloud that had wrapped around it during the night. The early morning air, which one consumes in large gulps, is as fresh as the strongest imaginable peppermint candy. Campfire smoke swirls about, unwilling to leave the compound. In the near distance, farm dogs howl in competition with one another, greeting each new dawn as though it were the last.</p> 

<p>It is early winter and the snow cover will retreat as the day warms: by early afternoon it will be visible only on the higher plains.</p>

<p>Breakfast is chabbati bread with egg, supplemented by apple jam and buffalo yogurt, and washed down with lots of coffee. Coffee has never tasted so good&mdash;thanks to the weather, I suspect. I eat with the guards, watching the cook squatting over a gas stove as he prepares the food. A ray of sunlight shoots through the steam from boiling water.</p> 

<p>A pot of hot water is used for washing. Outside with your shirt off, the warmth of the water is nice, but only for a brief spell. Soon it begins to feel like a very cold shower. As the day progresses, temperatures rise considerably. By midday, one has peeled off most of the layers of clothes from that morning, and is reduced to wearing a t&ndash;shirt.</p>

<p>I am the only GOAL international staff member at this location in Kashmir, running the camp. I dispatch trucks, monitor funds, ensure that the place is kept clean and tidy, and generally deal with any problems that arise. Above all else, the trucks of OFDA aid must be kept running, and it is my job to ensure that they are. If the aid trucks are slipping at the entrance to the camp, send five tractors to the river, fill them with rocks and get the men to break them into gravel to build a driveway. Anything to keep the aid convoys on the road.</p>

<p>At five o&#146;clock I&#146;ll pay our casual staff, and get ready to face another battle against the oncoming cold. Before having dinner, I&#146;ll do some preparatory paperwork for the next day. At night, before retiring to my tent, I huddle for a while beside the gas fire. Dogs are still barking nearby, and the OFDA aid is still moving. With a blanket across my shoulders, I soon make my way to the tent, climb into the cot, and read a book until my hands become too cold to hold it. If I&#146;m lucky, there will be a steady patter of rain, to save me the bother of having to count sheep.</p>
