<p>In January 2013, a mortar shell struck an apartment in Dar&#146;a Governorate. A mother in an adjoining apartment grabbed her 7-month old son Dia&#146;a&#42; and ran to check for survivors.</p>

<p>Just as she discovered her brother was killed in the attack, another mortar shell hit the building&mdash;this time killing one of her other sons. The explosion also ruptured a water heater, blasting scalding water on Dia&#146;a&#146;s face and right arm.</p>

<p>Dia&#146;a was rushed to a nearby Syrian government-run medical clinic, where many believe that women and children can safely receive care. After Dia&#146;a received basic aid, a worker at the clinic discreetly warned the mother that they should leave before she and her son were both killed.</p>

<p>The family fled to the Jordanian border and were received by Jordanian border guards, who transported them to Za&#146;atri refugee camp. During the trip, Dia&#146;a contracted a severe infection, which needed to heal before further he could receive treatment.</p>

<p>Every four hours, a medical team at a U.S.-funded clinic is changing the dressings on Dia&#146;a&#146;s burns. As soon as the infection is gone, doctors at the clinic will perform a skin graft. Doctors expect Dia&#146;a will make a full recovery, despite the scars from his burns.</p>

<p>Dia&#146;a&#146;s mother expressed gratefulness for the care her son is receiving at the U.S.-funded medical clinic and also thanked the Jordanian government for assisting her family and countless other Syrians in their time of need.</p>

<p>In total, the United States is providing more than $2.4 billion to help the innocent children, women, and men affected by the crisis in Syria. U.S. humanitarian aid includes emergency medical care and medical supplies, food aid, and winterization and other relief supplies that will help more than 10.8 million people in Syria, as well as the more than 2.9 million who have fled to the safety of neighboring countries.</p>
