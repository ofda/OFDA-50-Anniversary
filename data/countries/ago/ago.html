<p>It was early 1990, just months after communism had collapsed in Eastern Europe. The Cold War was quietly coming to a close and Americans debated how best to spend what became known as, &#147;the peace dividend&#148;. But for those of us whose humanitarian work drew us to more troubled parts of the world, life was anything but peaceful&mdash;as I experienced first&ndash;hand on an unlikely journey to war&ndash;torn eastern Angola that year, traveling together with a 3&ndash;member team from USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).</p>
 
<p>At one level, our mission appeared challenging but straight forward:  establish a desperately needed immunization campaign that would protect countless thousands of small children, who were dying needlessly from diseases that were totally preventable. However, we knew that reaching the children who needed the vaccines most would not be easy. Not only did they reside in remote areas of one of southern Africa&#146;s least developed nations, but the areas themselves were effectively combat zones in a long-running, brutal civil war. The fact they were controlled by the feared rebel leader Jonas Savimbi merely further complicated our task.</p>
 
<p>For OFDA, the challenge was to negotiate humanitarian access on both sides of the Angola war&#146;s battle lines and part of the job was already done. The government in Luanda had agreed to support a vaccination campaign involving the United Nations, OFDA and other international donors in the mainly urban areas under its control.</p>
  
<p>Now came the hard part: gaining assurances from Savimbi personally that his forces&mdash;who controlled much of Angola&#146;s countryside at the time&mdash;would neither harm our International Medical Corps vaccinators nor interfere with their lifesaving work. For OFDA, such sensitive work was not new. Just two years before, it had helped negotiate humanitarian access to assist civilians on both sides of a civil war raging in southern Sudan. It was an unprecedented diplomatic success that paved the way for subsequent humanitarian interventions, including those in Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Darfur that would save countless lives and ease immeasurable suffering. The heroism of the OFDA team members working in such places, who navigate the fighting or broker tenuous ceasefires so that innocent civilians can survive, is impossible to describe.</p>

<p>The OFDA negotiating team with me in Angola, which included then&ndash;Director Andrew Natsios, Assistant Director for Emergency Response Bill Garvelink and Regional Advisor for Africa Kate Farnsworth, had worked to arrange a rendezvous with the rebel leader at his lair in southeastern Angola. They succeeded in arranging a meeting, but the outcome included a set of unsettlingly vague instructions on how to reach the rendezvous point. What followed was without question the most harrowing trip I&#146;ve ever taken.</p>

<p>The four of us boarded a small bush plane in the dead of night for a flight to Savimbi&#146;s secret jungle compound. Our pilot was instructed to fly in a specific direction but without a map or other instructions. He was told only that when he reached the destination, Savimbi rebels would send up a flare.</p>

<p>I had never seen such darkness as we flew on through the night. Not a flicker of light anywhere. Then suddenly a flare went up&mdash;a single, brief beam of light splitting the darkness. That was it. No visible airport, no runway lights. Just the flare.</p>

<p>We landed on a tiny airstrip, got off the plane and were greeted by heavily armed rebel soldiers who promptly blindfolded us all&mdash;even though it was so dark we hardly needed them. We had no idea where we were.</p>

<p>Blindfolds firmly in place, the soldiers led us to Savimbi&#146;s compound. Only when we arrived were our blindfolds removed. We found ourselves standing in the doorway of a lighted stairway leading down to an underground bunker. For a brief moment after being told to proceed down the stairs, we stood still&mdash;until my colleague, Bill Garvelink, turned to me, smiled and said, &#147;Well, ladies first.&#148;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs, waiting to greet us was Savimbi himself. He welcomed us with an outstretched hand and an inviting smile. But when I looked into his eyes I saw only a coldness that reminded us of who he really was&mdash;a battle&ndash;hardened guerilla leader who had killed many people. Over the next two days, we persuaded Savimbi to allow safe passage for our health workers to enter rebel&ndash;controlled areas and administer the vaccinations that would save so many lives.</p>

<p>In a highly unusual&mdash;if not unprecedented&mdash;decision, the warring parties also agreed that the vaccinators selected to work in their respective areas of control would become part of a joint training program, with vaccinators from both sides sitting in the same classroom. It seemed clear that everyone wanted to protect their children.</p>
 
<p>International Medical Corps eventually trained more than 200 vaccinators, program administrators and trainers whose collective effort during the first 16 months after our meeting with Savimbi led to more than 176,000 immunizations being administered to the women and children of southeastern Angola.</p>
 
<p>In the years that followed, with continued OFDA funding and the support of Tami Halmrast&ndash;Sanchez from OFDA headquarters in Washington, our locally&ndash;trained vaccinators went on to immunize tens of thousands more women and children. When our trip to Angola first began, we had determined that the time, the effort and the risks involved in meeting a rebel leader at his headquarters deep in territory his forces controlled would be worth it. Fortunately, we were right.</p>
 
<p>Today, two and a half decades later, humanitarians face a strikingly similar challenge as easily preventable diseases such as polio and measles gain new footholds because long-running armed conflicts prevent the vaccinators from doing the work so crucial in containing&mdash;and perhaps one day eliminating&mdash;such diseases. Our efforts continue so that success one day will come to them all.</p>
