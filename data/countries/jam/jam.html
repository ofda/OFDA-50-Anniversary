<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">Juanita Rilling, Director of the Center for International Disaster Information</span>

<p>1988 conjures up many memories:  Nike launched its iconic &#147;Just do it&#148; tagline, Doppler radar was invented, and &#147;The Cosby Show&#148; made dancing in colorful sweaters a cool thing to do. In the humanitarian aid arena, 1988 was the year of two mega disasters.</p> 

<p>Hurricane Gilbert&mdash;a Category 5 tropical cyclone&mdash;hit the United States, Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, the Leeward Islands, the Windward Islands, the Yucatan Peninsula, and Central America in September of 1988.</p>

<p>The outpouring of compassion, the number of people looking to volunteer, and the volume of material donations from the United States were epic and sustained. Americans are generous and donated tons of food, clothing, and other supplies that they felt would be helpful to survivors. While well-intended, the donations actually took up space that was needed to stage and deliver life&ndash;saving relief supplies, and USAID and other responders spent valuable time managing unneeded clothing, expired medicine, and other non-critical items to make way for vital relief supplies. Public inquiries about where to donate and how to volunteer flooded in at a rate of 80 calls an hour, overwhelming relief workers who struggled to manage the needs of survivors, as well as the demands of donors. For disaster relief organizations, this called attention to a need for public education about effective donations, and was only a taste of public interest in disasters yet to come.</p>

<p>On December 7th 1988, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Armenia, and was so destructive that the Soviet Union&#146;s leader at the time, Mikhail Gorbachev, requested humanitarian assistance from the U.S. government. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) led and coordinated the response efforts. And again, the American public responded with fervor, prompting even more inquiries about donations than during Hurricane Gilbert.</p>

<p>USAID OFDA experienced the merits and the downside when thousands of people want to help but do not know the most effective ways to do so. As a result, USAID established the Center for International Disaster Information (CIDI) in 1988. Since then, USAID CIDI has worked to inform the public about the best ways to support disaster&ndash;affected people around the world.</p>
 
<p>USAID CIDI takes in questions and referrals about donations from federal agencies, including USAID and the Departments of State and Defense, and direct calls to its Disaster Donations Hotline. USAID CIDI also maintains an online database, which collects information from website visitors and phone calls about proposed donations. Database content is shared with NGOs through an agreement between USAID CIDI and InterAction so that NGOs can identify commodities they may be able to use to help people in need.</p>

<p>What has USAID CIDI encouraged thousands of people to do over the last 26 years? Practice Smart Compassion:  channel benevolence and generosity into the most effective way to help relief efforts&mdash;which is through cash donations to relief organizations working directly with disaster&ndash;affected people. Why is cash the most effective donation? Cash enables organizations to purchase exactly what is needed, when it is needed, and to do so locally. This ensures that supplies are fresh, culturally appropriate, available quickly, and in the right amounts.</p>
 
<p>To help illustrate this, USAID CIDI has the Greatest Good Donations Calculator. For example, if a donor buys a 6&ndash;pack of half&ndash;liter water bottles for $1.14 in Washington, D.C. and donates it to Istanbul, Turkey, the price of shipping alone &#91;not to mention storage, distribution, customs and other fees.&#93; would be $192.65. If that $192.65 were donated in cash to a relief organization, 38,530 liters of clean water could be procured locally. This would provide 19,265 people with 2 liters of clean drinking water for a day.</p> 

<p>Along with the Greatest Good Donations Calculator, USAID CIDI is available via email, phone, or social media to answer inquiries about disaster donations and related subjects. The website also has fundraising tips, ways to repurpose a material donation once it&#146;s been collected, and much more. All are resources available to the public to help demonstrate that cash donations are truly easiest for donors, most efficient for relief organizations and most effective for disaster&ndash;affected communities.</p>
