<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Alison Lapp and Helen Ho</span>


<p>Prior to March 11, 2011, the U.S. government (USG) had responded to international disasters ranging from conflict to cholera and from floods to fires, but it had never provided humanitarian assistance following a major nuclear crisis overseas. However, when a powerful tsunami struck the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in eastern Japan, sparking one of the most serious nuclear meltdowns in history, OFDA&#146;s leadership and existing capabilities laid the groundwork for an unprecedented response.</p> 

<p>OFDA deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) within hours of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that generated the tsunami, activating an agreement with the Fairfax County and L.A. County fire departments to bring USAR professionals to Japan to search for survivors. OFDA also deployed its own expert on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive hazards to observe and advise on the situation at Fukushima Daiichi. As the severity of the damage to the nuclear plant became apparent in the days following the tsunami, OFDA applied a strategy that had proven successful in previous disasters: expanding the disaster response team to include technical specialists with advanced knowledge of the needs on the ground. In this case, OFDA augmented its team with colleagues from the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), who facilitated assessments of conditions in and near the damaged power plant. These specialists also offered technical expertise to the Government of Japan (GoJ) and the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)&mdash;the owner of Fukushima Daiichi&mdash;on bringing the nuclear crisis under control. Since this emergency was the first international disaster response many of the USG specialists had participated in, OFDA provided the humanitarian leadership, as well as the operational and administrative support that allowed them to contribute their expertise quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>As the USG and the GoJ had never before collaborated to manage a nuclear emergency, in the beginning, both governments were writing the rules of the response as it unfolded. Early requests for assistance occurred on an ad hoc basis, emanating from multiple GoJ agencies and arriving at numerous USG offices. No system existed to help avoid duplication, streamline communication, and ensure that the USG was responding to the most pressing humanitarian needs. To standardize and improve the process, OFDA looked to the way it organizes humanitarian tasks for another influential entity that often receives a barrage of emergency assistance requests&mdash;the U.S. military. For years, OFDA and DoD have implemented a system whereby OFDA vets and validates third&ndash;party requests for U.S. military humanitarian assistance to ensure that tasks are appropriate and will help meet identified needs. This OFDA&ndash;DoD tasking validation process proved to be a good model for enabling the UGS to more efficiently receive, vet, and respond to GoJ requests for USG assistance.</p>

<p>By mid&ndash;April the DART had worked with colleagues at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo to assemble the Bilateral Assistance Coordination Cell (BACC)&mdash;a USG interagency group with the technical knowledge to assess requests and the political standing to converse with the GoJ and other donors regarding the best way to address them. The BACC presented a single window into the USG through which the GoJ could direct requests for assistance. Through coordination with the GoJ, the BACC identified the Crisis Management Team lead by Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Goshi Hosono as the sole GoJ point of contact for discussions on USG nuclear assistance, thereby creating a single, mutually endorsed stream of communication between the two governments.</p>

<p>With OFDA assistance, the BACC also systematized the provision of assistance in response to the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi by forming thematically organized GoJ&ndash;USG working groups that met regularly. The meetings occurred at the political, operational, and technical levels to promote collaboration at each stage of the process needed to bring joint nuclear response activities to fruition.</p>

<p>Japan&#146;s status as a developed nation means that no USAID development mission exists in country, which left OFDA without the traditional partner to which it would transition activities as the response moved from relief to recovery. However, by forming the BACC, OFDA and the wider USG ensured the sustainability and continuity of support to the GoJ. The BACC represented a platform for U.S. Embassy staff to maintain consistent USG support after the DART left.</p>

<p>At every stage in the response, OFDA was presented with novel challenges that only arose due to the unique circumstances of a nuclear crisis in a developed nation. Yet, for every obstacle, OFDA was able to find a solution in its existing toolkit. From calling forward appropriate technical specialists in Washington, D.C., to collaborating with USG interagency colleagues in Japan, the DART used lessons learned from previous disasters to successfully meet the needs of this unique disaster, providing specialized equipment, technical advice, and logistics support to the GoJ. In doing so, OFDA contributed significantly to a coordinated response that allowed the USG to help the GoJ contain the impact of an unparalleled nuclear disaster on its people.</p>
