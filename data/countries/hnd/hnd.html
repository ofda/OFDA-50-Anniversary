<em>Q&A with Milton Funes, Country Director, Global Communities; Former Shelter Specialist for Hurricane Mitch response</em>


<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">Take us back to the Hurricane Mitch response in 1998&mdash;what was it like?</span><br />
 
<span style="color: black;font-size: 15px;">I&#146;m from Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, and when it comes to natural disasters I thought I lived in the safest place in Central America. Far from the Atlantic coast where hurricanes and tropical storms hit each storm season, and far from volcanoes and seismic&ndash;prone zones that had, in the previous two decades, devastated each capital city in the region. I thought Tegucigalpa was naturally protected by the mountains that surround it. In 1998, nature proved me wrong.</span></p>

<p>In October of that year, Tropical Storm Mitch was upgraded to a hurricane that developed into one of the strongest and most damaging storms to ever hit the Caribbean and Central America. Although the winds diminished as Hurricane Mitch traveled inland over Honduras on October 30, the storm continued to produce torrential rains which caused catastrophic floods and landslides throughout the country, including in Tegucigalpa.</p>
 
<p>A few weeks later, the National Emergency Commission reported that 5,657 persons were killed, 8,052 were missing, and 11,762 were injured and over 1 million left homeless as a result of the storm.</p>
 
<p>Damage to the nation&#146;s infrastructure isolated entire communities which made access by emergency aid workers extremely difficult and it hampered efforts to supply the larger cities with food, water, and other essentials.</p>

<p>Prior to Mitch making landfall, USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) had pre&ndash;positioned assets throughout the region along the storm&#146;s forecasted course, and was quick to launch its emergency relief efforts as the hurricane passed overland. OFDA&#146;s Disaster Assistance Response Team in Honduras assisted the National Emergency Operations Center, conducted field assessments, coordinated aircraft and transport logistics, and performed other disaster relief activities. OFDA channeled resources through Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) to expedite the emergency response across the country.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">How did you work with OFDA on that response?</span><br />
 
I&#146;m a civil engineer and urban planner, and right after Mitch, the mayor organized weekly meetings to plan emergency response and reconstruction activities in Tegucigalpa. These meetings were attended by hundreds of international relief workers, including OFDA-funded PVOs, who were to start up the response. Knowing very well my city and its Master Development Plan, I volunteered to guide foreign relief workers on how to best plan for transitional shelters settlements in and around Tegucigalpa. During this period I came across Global Communities (formerly CHF International) as one of the OFDA&ndash;funded organizations that were already implementing the Emergency Temporary Shelter Project, or ETS.</span></p>

<p>I was invited to join the Global Communities team as the Housing Manager at that time, when we needed to transform temporary shelters into more permanent solutions. The goal of the OFDA&ndash;funded Emergency Temporary Shelters (ETS) project was to relocate, either temporarily or permanently, up to 1,000 families to safe land, providing an individual temporary shelter for each family and basic communal sanitation facilities.</p>
 
<p>Additionally, the program wanted to relieve crowding in selected community shelters and demonstrate tangible action by municipalities, and for the National Emergency Commission, to respond to the needs of local families.</p>

<p>The temporary shelter design was a single family, low&ndash;cost unit made of a wood frame, plastic sheeting walls, and a corrugated metal roof. The house design allowed for the reuse of the plastic, wood, and zinc roof material in the construction of permanent shelters at a later date.</p>

<p>The success of the ETS project led to a second OFDA&ndash;funded project named ETS II. These projects demonstrated that temporary shelters are an excellent complement to permanent housing projects. As families acquire a piece of land and begin the long road of planning and building their permanent house, a safe, secure place to live near or on their permanent home site is very valuable. The project allowed families to leave community shelters immediately and live near the new home construction site, which facilitates the building and guarding of that home. Most importantly, the temporary shelters allowed families to begin a return to normal living as a family unit in their own temporary home.</p>

<p>Another thing that was important is that the communities regrouped around a constructive activity which was great for the individuals and the communities who had lost so much. People really appreciated having their own space and not being in a community shelter. Many of these temporary homes became the basis for more permanent homes.</p>

<p>Between 1999 and 2000, with support from OFDA, 13,812 people benefited from the 2,756 Emergency Temporary Shelters built by Global Communities in Honduras.</p>
 
<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">What were the main challenges and do you deem it a success?</span><br />

Again, damage to the nation&#146;s infrastructure isolated entire communities which made access by emergency aid workers extremely difficult and it hampered efforts to supply the larger cities with food, water, and other essentials. It took months before more semi&ndash;permanent solutions (such as ETS) were put in place due to limited access to the affected communities. In urban areas, such as the capital city, much of the land was declared at risk and families were not ready to move out of the city, fearing no access to services and livelihoods.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">How did the Hurricane Mitch response impact future shelter programs?</span><br />

Shelter programs have evolved much since Hurricane Mitch; today, programs focus on the efficient delivery of safe and habitable shelter, providing dignified, healthy, adequate space where affected households can protect their livelihoods and assets, and recover as fast as possible, establishing a degree of normalcy in their daily life.</p>
  
<p>Today shelter programs are integrated into holistic schemes to support well&ndash;planned settlements that maximize people&#146;s protection and security, and support them to minimize the spread of diseases, manage natural resources sustainably, but moreover, encourage long lasting solutions for the vulnerable based on self&ndash;reliance promotion.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">You&#146;ve been working with OFDA for many years&mdash;have you learned anything that you wish you knew before/on your first projects with OFDA?</span><br /> 

I&#146;ve learned that assisting a population in its ability to recover economically from disaster is one of the most important goals of humanitarian relief. Shelter Programs create a safe space for resuming or initiating critical income generation and asset restoration, while protecting and safeguarding productive household resources and promoting accelerated recovery. Shelter Programs provide a unique opportunity to build resilience among the most vulnerable.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">How has working with OFDA evolved over the years?</span><br />

Emergency response requires effective, informed and coordinated actions. Lessons learned from earlier efforts show that timely coordination, information sharing, logistical and supply analysis maximize the speed and effectiveness of interventions. Over the years I have witnessed how OFDA has enhanced its partnership model to build and strengthen coordination mechanisms and knowledge sharing in preparation for emergency response at national levels.</p>

<p>In October 2011 I was invited to participate in a Haiti Study tour organized by OFDA where a dozen participants from the Americas were familiarized with the key approaches and tools developed to inform the shelter and settlements response in the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake. Participants were asked to help disseminate that knowledge within their own organizations and countries. The study tour included presentations and field visits where participants had the opportunity to interact with project implementers, academics and government officials and learn from their experiences. This was very helpful to ensure that ongoing and future humanitarian responses are well coordinated.</p>

<p>Nowadays more than before, OFDA plans its interventions through participatory planning. It aims to empower local stakeholders by elevating them to the decision&ndash;making level through information sharing, collaboration, and trust&mdash;pillars of a strong partnership.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1; font-weight: 700;">Looking ahead over the next few decades, what do you think is the biggest challenge to improving the humanitarian system?</span><br />

I personally see two challenges in the humanitarian system:<br />

<p>1. Climate change &ndash; Natural disasters grow and evolve; as a consequence, emergency response must evolve as the climate changes, causing certain disasters to become more intense or more numerous in the future. There&#146;s not a &#147;one size fits all&#148; approach for emergency response.</p>

<p>2. Human Resources Turnover &ndash; Sustained Human Capacity in the humanitarian system is hampered by high staff turnover. The working environment in the humanitarian system differs significantly from all other sectors. The more salient differences involve working in a location far away from families and friends, under tremendous stress and in insecure environments; often in situations where workers frequently witness severe human suffering and pain. Acquiring, training and retaining a skilled humanitarian workforce are challenges for the system.</p>
