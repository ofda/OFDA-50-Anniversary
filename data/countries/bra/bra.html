<p>One of USAID/OFDA&#146;s most notable achievements in the adoption and implementation of its emergency response framework in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is found in the one mountain community situated at the confluence of three rivers where flooding is an annual reality.</p> 

<p>In the heart of Santa Catarina State in southern Brazil, Rio do Sul Municipality is located where the Itajai South and Itajai West rivers join with the formidable Itajai&ndash;A&#231;u River. Approximately 62,000 residents of this rapidly growing city have learned to live with heavy rains and a flood cycle that reaches peak heights every twenty five years on average.</p>

<p>In September 2011, after weeks of intermittent heavy rains followed by seven days of torrential downpours, the Itajai&ndash;A&#231;u River reached record heights not seen in more than a quarter of a century. Water levels rose 13 meters above mean&ndash;river height, leaving nearly 13 percent of Rio do Sul&#146;s urban center submerged under two meters of water. Unlike the 1983 and 1984 floods of similar magnitude, which resulted in numerous fatalities and required several months of recovery efforts, the Rio do Sul municipal government, State and Federal Civil Defense, and emergency management authorities responded quickly and efficiently to the 2011 flood.</p>

<p>In the words of Municipal Coordinator for the Rio do Sul Civil Defense Andre Gustavo Wormsbecher, who helped lead the 2011 flood response, &#147;By modeling &#91;USAID/OFDA&#146;s&#93; emergency contingency plan and adapting it to the specific needs of our city, in addition to USAID/OFDA training courses and technical assistance, the individual roles of each response organization during the 2011 flood&mdash;including local government actors, national and local civil defense authorities, and emergency response teams&mdash;were well defined and the necessary steps for a successful response and recovery clearly communicated.&#148;</p>

<p>By evaluating the city&#146;s Geographic Information System database&mdash;developed through an agreement with Santa Catarina State Secretary of Planning and Civil Defense and modeled after USAID/OFDA&#146;s disaster response framework&mdash;Rio do Sul&#146;s Civil Defense took risk mitigation measures that directly saved lives. As a result of this effort, authorities successfully alerted local populations of the impending floods and evacuated an estimated 12,000 people from vulnerable neighborhoods, housing those without alternative lodging in 28 pre&ndash;identified and equipped emergency shelters. Emergency crews also enacted protective measures for local infrastructure and prepared the city for possible damage.</p>

<p>For the first time in Rio do Sul history, authorities and emergency responders conducted an after&ndash;action review to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the city&#146;s emergency response plan and the actions taken. In addition, authorities analyzed the management of the three river dams leading into Rio do Sul that ensure that 38 municipalities, including the industrial metropolis of Blumenau, are protected from the majority of inundations. USAID/OFDA DRMS for Brazil Antonio Pinheiro and partner Santa Catarina State University (UDESC) provided technical assistance for the after&ndash;action review meeting.</p>

<p>In addition to the after&ndash;action review, the Rio do Sul municipal government is taking the initiative to increase awareness by implementing public education and flood preparedness campaigns, as well as through offering tax incentives for populations that build second stories on their homes and businesses in high&ndash;risk areas. The municipality also plans to build an additional four dams in the near future. With support and guidance from USAID/OFDA and partner UDESC, Rio do Sul represents the successful incorporation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) on a municipal level. In turn, USAID/OFDA plans to model its RDAP portfolio DRR course around the example of Rio do Sul.</p>
