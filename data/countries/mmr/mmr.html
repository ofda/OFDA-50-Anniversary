<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Michael Keegan</span>

<p>On May 2, 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck the Ayeyarwady Delta of Burma with a maximum sustained windspeed of more than 130 miles per hour. In addition to the high winds and heavy rainfall, the cyclone carried with it a storm surge of more than 12 feet, devastating the low&ndash;lying agricultural region and killing more than 130,000 people. The U.N. estimated that the cyclone affected approximately 2.4 million people, the majority of whom lived in the Ayeyarwady Delta.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;font weight: 700;">OFDA on the Ground</span><br />
USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), along with other humanitarian agencies, immediately began to respond to the devastating cyclone. OFDA deployed a Thailand&ndash;based Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to facilitate the U.S. government&#146;s humanitarian response to the cyclone. After initial limitations in humanitarian access, OFDA funded non&ndash;governmental organization (NGO) partners already working in Burma to provide assistance in vital sectors such as shelter, health, logistics, food, and water, sanitation, and hygiene. In the early days of the response, OFDA also worked with the Department of Defense to transport emergency relief supplies through a much&ndash;needed air bridge. OFDA&#146;s implementing partners then distributed the incoming emergency relief supplies to cyclone&ndash;affected populations.</p>

<p>In June 2008, assessment missions, including those conducted by OFDA disaster specialists, found that affected people were increasingly returning home, and that local populations identified restoration of their livelihoods as their greatest need. Such assistance would allow people to help themselves and restore their sense of dignity and self-reliance. People repeatedly told the OFDA disaster specialists that they needed a relatively small investment to resume productive activities.</p>

<p>For the majority of those affected, agricultural inputs&mdash;mainly seeds and agricultural tools&mdash;represented a particularly urgent need. In some areas of the Ayeyarwady Delta, the only planting season of the year begins in July, and farmers needed to replace the tools lost in the cyclone. Responding to this need, OFDA began to shift programming from meeting immediate humanitarian needs to providing support for early recovery.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;font weight: 700;">Early Recovery Initiatives</span><br />
From the very beginning, livelihoods and early recovery activities were integrated into OFDA emergency programming wherever possible. For example, a grant to an NGO partner for emergency shelter and water and sanitation included rapid agricultural rehabilitation support for seeds and tools. In the early recovery stage, OFDA focused on providing quick access to the means to restart livelihoods.</p>

<p>The first priority for the early recovery was to rapidly provide the needed agricultural inputs to farmers who were willing and able to plant a crop. The inputs given to farmers included seeds, tools, power tillers or draught animals, and cash to hire agricultural laborers.</p>

<p>An OFDA&ndash;funded agricultural recovery program helped one farmer support his wife, parents, and four children after the cyclone swept away his seeds and tools. Supplied with an improved variety of rice seeds, as well as access to a power tiller, the farmer was able to successfully harvest a larger&ndash;than&ndash;average rice crop for his family.</p>

<p>Another farmer in the delta recounted how the cyclone destroyed most of the houses in his village, while the floodwaters carried away the village&#146;s food and seed stocks. The village had given up hope of planting for the season until an OFDA&ndash;funded partner arrived with the seeds and tools needed to sow the rice paddies. Rather than repaying money borrowed at high interest rates to buy poor quality rice, the farmer planned to sell some of his rice crop and use the savings to gradually rebuild the family home.</p>

<p>OFDA&ndash;funded programs also supported landless laborers both directly and by providing the means by which farmers with land could hire workers. After losing his wife in the cyclone, a landless laborer who lived near Bogale town received relief supplies and found work at a local farm thanks to an OFDA&ndash;funded recovery program, helping him to support his two children.</p>

<p>Early recovery programming also focused on support for non&ndash;agricultural livelihoods, which included fishing, salt&ndash;panning, forestry, and small trade and manufacturing. Such activities were designed to restore livelihoods activities that existed prior to the cyclone, and to avoid significant movement of labor into new activities.</p>

<p>Another means of supporting early recovery in the areas hardest hit by the cyclone was the re&ndash;capitalization of previously existing and effective microcredit programs. In the aftermath of the cyclone, OFDA supported established microcredit programs that returned the savings or forgave the loans of participants affected by the cyclone who needed additional capital to restart their participation in the programs.</p>

<p>Through the transition from emergency relief to support for early recovery and livelihoods, OFDA provided timely and appropriate assistance to residents of the Ayeyarwady Delta. By helping people to resume their livelihoods, OFDA&ndash;funded programs also helped to mitigate the need for future humanitarian assistance.</p>
