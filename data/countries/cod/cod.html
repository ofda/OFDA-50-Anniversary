<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Emmanuel d&#146;Harcourt, Health Director, the International Rescue Committee</span>

<p>Back in 2000, the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was a footnote to world events. A <em>New York Times</em> article referred to 100,000 deaths, but International Rescue Committee (IRC) staff in Congo knew, from the devastation they witnessed every day, that this was probably an underestimate. To get to the answer, IRC epidemiologists&mdash;using innovative methods and at considerable personal risks&mdash;undertook a series of surveys that showed that millions, not thousands, were dying as a result of the war.</p>

<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) was one of the first agencies to act on the findings, offering immediate support for what had been an underfunded emergency. This support enabled the IRC to dramatically expand its response in South Kivu&mdash;then the epicenter of the conflict&mdash;reestablishing services in dozens of medical clinics. The focus on primary health care was deliberate in light of survey findings that most war deaths were the result of a disruption in basic services, rather than direct violence. OFDA funded medicines, supplies, and stipends for health care workers.</p>

<p>The effect was immediate. Many clinics had been closed, and those that were open only had a few patients&mdash;those willing to pay high prices for medicines bought privately by health&ndash;center staff. The picture changed overnight with OFDA support:  waiting rooms were full, and health centers hired additional nurses who saw patients all day in the available consultation rooms.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to directly witness the life&ndash;saving impact of this primary care. As we were talking to patients, a group of people came in carrying a middle&ndash;aged man on a plastic tarp. The man was gaunt, his clothes hanging off his shoulders, his eyes enormous in their hollowed orbits. The plastic tarp had feces, completely liquid. The staff knew exactly what he had: cholera, which is endemic in this part of Eastern Congo. Just as importantly, they knew exactly what to do. They prepared an IV drip while he sipped a cup of oral rehydration solution.</p>

<p>This man&#146;s life was saved by a few dollars of intravenous supplies, just as the lives of thousands of children were saved by simple antibiotics, and those of pregnant women by vials of oxytocin to stop bleeding after childbirth&mdash;all thanks to OFDA support. This help was not limited to easy&ndash;to&ndash;reach areas. OFDA&#146;s assistance reached the far hills of Minembwe and Itombwe, which required staff to fly by small plane to a grass landing strip before walking for hours to reach isolated clinics. Many of these clinics had not been visited, much less supplied with medicines, for years before OFDA support kicked in. This aid would not have reached places such as Minembwe without the dedication of Congolese staff, as well as expatriates such as George Kijana and Elizabeth Wayamba, who lived and worked there in difficult conditions.</p>

<p>The OFDA&ndash;funded program was innovative for its time given its combination of emergency relief while also strengthening the health care systems. Conventional wisdom would keep those in separate phases, but the IRC&#146;s Congolese staff knew that emergency health care would be most effective when administered through tight supply&ndash;chains and quality&ndash;control systems. They also knew that the primary health care system in DRC&mdash;one of the first and most sophisticated when it was rolled out in the 1970&#146;s&mdash;would respond well, and quickly, to this kind of support. The IRC and Ministry of Health nurses worked as a seamless team as they did stock counts, monitored adherence to clinical protocols, and reformed local health committees.</p>

<p>The OFDA&ndash;supported program built on the existing health system, but it also occasionally broke with this system. One important change was the abolition of user fees. These fees, ranging from one to several U.S. dollars, were enough to prevent many of the poorest people from using health services. Predictably, eliminating the fee allowed thousands of poor people to get the care they would not have received otherwise. We used data from OFDA&ndash;supported programs to advocate to the Congolese government to make services free of charge, at least for women and children, as was done in other post&ndash;conflict countries, such as Sierra Leone. This advocacy effort still continues.</p>

<p>It&#146;s important to note that OFDA&#146;s support was not purely financial. One persistent challenge was monitoring, as the population numbers in Eastern DRC at that time could shift substantially and on short notice. OFDA advisors, such as Dr. Heather Papowitz, helped us find solutions to those challenges.</p>

<p>I look back with pride at the work IRC did in South Kivu. It was simple in its aims, but challenging in its execution. The legacy of lives saved, strengthened systems and good will remains as South Kivu has transitioned, albeit fitfully, from humanitarian aid to development assistance. I feel gratitude towards the local and expatriate staff who carried out exemplary work in difficult circumstances; and towards OFDA for being among the first, and most generous, supporters to the Congolese people in their hour of need.</p>
