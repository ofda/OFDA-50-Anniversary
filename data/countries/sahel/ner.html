<p dir="ltr"><span style="color:#16B0C1;font-size: 21px;font-weight: 700;">Niger&#146;s Tree of Life</span><br />
<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Helen Ho</span>

<p>In southwestern Niger, where rainfall is sparse and droughts are common, the landscape of Dantchandou village was once characterized by expanses of dry, dusty ground dotted with shrubs and the occasional tree. Today, in its place is a lush landscape teeming with moringa. Often called the Tree of Life, moringa is a drought-resistant, fast-growing tree with highly nutritious leaves. The seeds can grow more than 10 feet tall within one year and begin producing leaves within three months of planting, and even with minimal watering, a tree can provide an adequate crop of highly nutritious leaves, allowing families to supplement their food stocks year-round, but particularly during the annual dry season.</p> 

<p>Latchi Djibo, a divorced mother of eight and the secretary of a local moringa producers association, lives in town. A sign over the entrance to her home reads <em>Chez Madame Moringa</em>. &#147;I call myself Madame Moringa because moringa is my husband now. Moringa helps me take care of my family,&#148; she says.</p>

<p>Through a USAID-funded project that she joined in 2010, Djibo has learned to grow, process and sell moringa. By collecting leaves from the moringa trees she has planted around her home, Djibo can prepare a variety of moringa-based dishes for her family and to sell in the village. She also buys moringa leaves from other producers to sell in neighboring markets, sometimes traveling as far as the capital of Niamey, located 50 miles away.</p>

<p>&#147;In addition, I apply what I have learned with the project,&#148; explains Latchi. &#147;I advise on the nutritional virtues &#91;of moringa&#93; by talking to my customers about the beneficial effects, especially for women and children.&#148; Moringa leaves contain significant amounts of protein, calcium, iron, and vitamins. In fact, by consuming only two tablespoons of moringa leaf powder, adults can meet one-third of their daily protein needs, 75 percent of their calcium needs, and 100 percent of their vitamin A needs.</p>

<p>Since starting her moringa enterprise, Latchi has earned approximately $80 every month&mdash;a substantial amount in Niger, one of the poorest countries in Africa. &#147;Before, I was unknown,&#148; she reports, &#147;but now, thanks to the project, my name and the name of my village is everywhere, and I receive phone calls regularly just to...let me know that my moringa product is good.&#148;</p>

<p>With the income she earns from selling moringa leaves and dishes, Latchi buys maize, rice, and other food to feed her children, as well as clothes, school supplies, and medicines. Perhaps more importantly, no one in her family has been malnourished since she started farming moringa.</p>

<p>In Dantchandou village, Latchi continues to regularly entertain visitors eager to witness the greening of her village. &#147;While there have been projects in my village, and there may still be a few others, there has not been another project like the moringa one, which has pulled us out of extreme poverty, malnutrition, and hunger,&#148; says Latchi.</p>
