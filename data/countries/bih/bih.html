<p>Over 2.5 million Bosnians were forced to flee their homes when war in the former Yugoslavia erupted in 1991. In response, USAID&#146;s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the region in December 1992 to monitor humanitarian assistance programs. With the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in late 1995, the conflict ended and OFDA worked to determine how best to contribute to the Bosnian rehabilitation effort. Given the number of people who fled their homes, and with so many houses badly damaged during the conflict, the DART determined that an emergency shelter repair program (ESRP) would be the most effective way to help the Bosnian people return to normalcy. The ESRP also sought to build local capacities, minimize dependence on relief assistance, and leverage other donor assistance.</p>

<p>Starting in March 1996, the ESRP repaired 2,500 badly damaged houses using local labor to help generate short-term jobs and stimulate and strengthen local contractors. Repairs included weather-sealing and insulation for the main living space; replacing the tile floor, toilet, and sink in one bathroom; and installing some electrical wiring, outlets, and lights. Families took responsibility for any other necessary repairs, such as painting the exterior, repairing additional rooms, or planting gardens. In this way, the ESRP helped people return to their homes, while also preventing dependency by providing assistance for only those needs which the families and the community could not meet on their own.</p>

<p>The ESRP also injected millions of dollars into the local economy, enhanced existing capacities and created over 4,000 jobs by hiring 174 local contracting firms to rebuild homes. In addition, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) purchased most building materials locally, thereby stimulating local markets. For example, in Dejcici, an NGO installed a lumber mill to produce all of the roof beams and floor boards used in the shelter program. After the project was completed, it was donated to the local forestry company. Another NGO supported the local production of window frames, floor boards, roof beams, and roof tiles.</p>

<p>The ESRP was also a good example of cooperation between USAID bureaus, and in leveraging resources from other donors. To complement the shelter program, OFDA and other USAID bureaus provided an additional $4 million to implement a mini-infrastructure repair program focusing on rehabilitation and repair of water and electrical systems, health clinics, and schools. The ESRP created a magnet effect, which drew other donors. As the ESRP provided funding for home repairs, other donors such as the European Commission&#146;s Humanitarian aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the World Bank, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Management Group provided funding for utility and municipal building repairs. Together, these programs created the conditions necessary to entice people to return to their homes (even if their houses were not repaired under the ESRP), by ensuring that villages had adequate schools, hospitals, and utilities.</p>
