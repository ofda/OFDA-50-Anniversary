<span style="color: black;font-size: 13px;">By Amber Callaway</span>

<p>As the old cruise ship Red Star One approached Misratah for its sixth evacuation mission, the crew could hear rockets falling near the port. Here, thousands of people had set up camp and were anxiously waiting to be evacuated from the besieged city in western Libya. The vessel&mdash;carrying an OFDA-supported medical response team and life-saving supplies&mdash;had been forced to anchor at sea for five days after pro-Qadhafi forces laid sea mines in the harbor. Once the ship was able to dock, the crew quickly unloaded supplies and the team of International Medical Corps (IMC) doctors helped the injured board. Rocket fire resumed and the ship was forced to depart Misratah within an hour of docking, carrying approximately 800 people, 200 fewer than the mission&#146;s organizer&mdash;the International Organization for Migration (IOM)&mdash;had hoped. Inside the makeshift clinic onboard the vessel, doctors worked tirelessly to stabilize the wounded for the 250-mile journey to Benghazi, where ambulances waited to transfer the patients to hospitals. Ensuring that these critically wounded individuals inside Libya received the urgent medical care they needed is just one of the many ways that OFDA carried out a critical component of its decisive and focused mandate&mdash;save lives.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;">Unrest in Libya</span><br />
The uprising in Libya, inspired by popular revolts in Egypt and Tunisia, met a violent response from the Libyan government. The ensuing conflict took a heavy toll on Libya&#146;s people, infrastructure, and economy. Entire communities were uprooted, traditional supply routes were cut off, and the Libyan people faced shortages of food, water, and fuel. While a coalition that included the U.S., as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and several Arab states took military action against the Qadhafi regime, OFDA mobilized and coordinated the U.S. government&#146;s humanitarian response inside the country.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;strong;">OFDA Employs Speed and Flexibility</span><br />
Days after violence began to escalate in late February, OFDA deployed teams of humanitarian experts to neighboring countries, preparing its staff and its partners to enter Libya as soon as security permitted. Through pre-established relationships with relief agencies on the ground, OFDA began piecing together the realities of the situation and identifying when and where needs were greatest. Before even stepping foot on Libyan soil, OFDA was providing targeted, life-saving assistance through NGOs and U.N. agencies. In early April, as the frontlines fluctuated between Libya&#146;s central coastal towns, a small U.S. government (USG) team was able to enter Benghazi, the opposition stronghold in eastern Libya. Although the city&#146;s conflict-damaged airport was not yet operational, OFDA exercised its logistical capabilities and expertise to mobilize a boat and other critical resources to get the USG team, including the U.S. Special Envoy for Libya and two Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) members, on the ground as fast as possible. The DART immediately began assessing humanitarian needs in coordination with other donors, relief agencies, and local authorities,ensuring that U.S. assistance was efficient, effective, and provided in response to the most pressing, unmet humanitarian needs.</p>

<p><span style="color:#16B0C1;">The Nuts and Bolts of Saving Lives in Libya</span><br />
Although Libya&#146;s health system was well-established, the majority of nurses and doctors were from other countries and had joined thousands of others fleeing to neighboring countries to escape the violence. Concurrently, medical supply  chains  were  cut, and, as the conflict spread, the volume of trauma patients quickly overwhelmed the capacity of local hospitals. From east to west, the Libyan health system&#146;s ability to provide live-saving medical assistance was severely impaired at a time when critical injuries were increasing significantly.</p>

<p>Recognizing the importance of supporting rather than replacing local health systems, OFDA focused on bolstering local clinics and hospitals with staff and supplies. OFDA was able to deliver supplies and provide doctors and nurses to work in hospitals and clinics near the frontlines through health-focused organizations like IMC. For example, IMC leveraged a pre-existing relationship with the Jordanian Health Aid Society to bring in 82 Arabic-speaking nurses to clinics and hospitals in eastern Libya; these nurses cared for and treated more than 13,800 civilian patients.</p>

<p>When the city of Misratah first came under siege, IMC used fishing boats to deliver much needed medicines from Malta. And, as the conflict in Misratah intensified and continued, OFDA deployed IMC doctors and nurses to work in overwhelmed health facilities, some of which were receiving more than 70 casualties per day. The teams established rotation systems to relieve exhausted surgeons and nurses, coordinated medical evacuations, and stabilized patients on vessels like Red Star One. When fighting moved from Misratah to nearby Dafniya town, IMC, with OFDA support, opened a field hospital near the frontline. OFDA also worked with IMC to provide the first doctors and shipment of life-saving supplies to medical facilities in the Nafusah Mountains of western Libya, where indiscriminate missiles and rockets took a heavy toll on the population. And, when the battle began in the streets of Tripoli on August 21, OFDA-supported IMC teams arrived on the scene within 24 hours. These doctors, nurses, and medical support professionals worked for 72 hours straight, receiving new civilian trauma patients, clearing the patient backlog, and supporting hospital management. While it is impossible to know exactly how many lives OFDA saved in Libya, the assistance undoubtedly made a huge difference&mdash;in some cases between life and death&mdash;for thousands of men, women, and children.</p>
