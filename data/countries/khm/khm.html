<p>As floods in Cambodia reached waist height in September and October 2011, inundating fields and destroying crops, the last thing one might have expected people to need was more water. However, Thouk Reth was one of many in the affected community who found himself surrounded by a world submerged, yet wishing for water of a different kind&emdash;safe drinking water for himself, his wife, and their two children.</p>

<p>Heavy rains fell over nearly all of Cambodia in the fall of 2011, with floodwaters spreading across 18 of 24 provinces, dampening prospects for 1.5 million people and destroying nearly 10 percent of the nation&#146;s crops. In many areas, floodwaters also flowed into low-lying and uncovered community wells, contaminating families&#146; only source of drinking water and increasing the risk of waterborne disease transmission. To prevent this problem from recurring during Cambodia&#146;s annual flood season, OFDA upgraded more than 350 community wells in the most affected provinces of Kandal and Kampong Thom through World Vision, raising wells as much as 10 feet above ground and equipping them with concrete covers and hand pumps to dispense the water protected within. This progress surpassed the number of water points originally targeted for improvement by more than 100 wells. The water supply for more than 28,000 people is now safer from flood contamination, thanks to the project.</p>

<p>Approximately 13 families draw water from the upgraded well in Thouk&#146;s village in Prasath Ballang District of Kampong Thom Province, and none experienced stomach sickness in the months following the water source rehabilitation, he noted.</p>

<p>&#147;I know [OFDA] could not give us each a well, but it&#146;s the same as if you had, [your own well] because there is enough clean water in this one for us all to share,&#148; Thouk said.</p>

<p>Working with World Vision, OFDA also distributed water purification tablets to nearly 3,400 families, many of whom stored the supplies so that they would be available for immediate water treatment during the next seasonal floods. Doing this enabled the families to keep a step ahead of potentially debilitating hydrometeorological events that, by nature of their predictability in the region, can be withstood without significant health consequences, as long as effective preparedness measures like this are in place.</p>

<p>As in other communities that received well rehabilitations, residents of Dong village, where Thouk lives, pitched in to help elevate the well&#146;s base through OFDA-sponsored temporary employment. Similar cash-for-work initiatives included cleaning schools and repairing flood-damaged roads&mdash;projects that provided needed income to families that lost crops to the floods. The work allowed affected communities to participate in upgrading their shared wells, making the improvements more than just a gift, but also a commitment to safeguarding drinking water in flood-prone areas shared among OFDA, World Vision, and, most importantly, the families that use the wells.</p>
